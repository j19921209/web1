  <h2>WEB</h2>
  <p>The World Wide Web, also known as the WWW and the Web, is an information space<br>
    where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs),<br>
    interlinked by hypertext links, and accessible via the Internet.[1] English scientist<br>
    Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser in 1990<br>
    while employed at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland.[2][3] The browser was released outside <br>
    CERN in 1991, first to other research institutions starting in January 1991 and to the general public<br>
    on the Internet in August 1991. The World Wide Web has been central to the development of <br>
    the Information Age and is the primary tool billions of people use to interact on the Internet.<br>
    Web pages are primarily text documents formatted and annotated with Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).<br>
    In addition to formatted text, web pages may contain images, video, audio, and software components<br>
    that are rendered in the user's web browser as coherent pages of multimedia content.</p>
